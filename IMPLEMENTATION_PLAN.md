## Priority 1 — Beta Season 1 Transition (베타 시즌 1)

Umbrella spec: `specs/beta-season-transition.md` — 2026-07-06 target date.

**Dependency chain** (implement in this order):
```
1.1 Season Constant  ←  foundation for all beta work
1.2 Orange Rebalance ←  standalone, no cross-dependencies
1.3 Rarity & Credits ←  account schema for Crimson + Gacha
1.4 Daily Gacha      ←  sole source of credits
1.5 Crimson Character ← hero tier (900 credits), needs rarity shop
1.6 Red Theme Skins  ←  beta_red_crimson needs Crimson to exist
1.7 Patch Notes      ←  last step, after all features land
```

### 1.1 Season Constant Change
- [ ] `main.js:176`: Change `CURRENT_SEASON` from `"alpha4"` to `"beta1"`
- [ ] `main.js:177-182`: Add `beta1: "베타 시즌 1"` to `SEASONS` object
- [ ] `langs.js`: Update `season` key from `"알파 시즌 4"` to `"베타 시즌 1"` (ko) / `"Alpha Season 4"` to `"Beta Season 1"` (en)
- [ ] Verify: new accounts get `seasonStats.beta1` / `seasonCharStats.beta1` initialized
- [ ] Verify: existing alpha accounts auto-create `beta1` keys on load (migration logic already exists)
- [ ] Verify: profile "시즌별 전적" shows beta1 with current-season marker (⬅)

### 1.2 Orange Rebalance — `specs/orange-rebalance.md`
- [ ] `CHARACTERS.orange.bombDamage`: 750 → 900
- [ ] `CHARACTERS.orange.bombSplashDamage`: 300 → 380
- [ ] `CHARACTERS.orange.bombSpeed`: 22 → 26
- [ ] `CHARACTERS.orange.bombSplashHitRadius`: 0.60 → 0.75
- [ ] Verify: other Orange stats unchanged (HP 5800, range 9, splashCount 5, splashSpeed 10, splashRange 4.4)
- [ ] Effective full-hit total becomes 900 + (380×5) = 2,800 (up from 2,250, +24%)

### 1.3 Character Rarity & Credit System — `specs/character-rarity-shop.md`
- [ ] Define rarity tiers: Common (red/green/blue — free), Rare (orange/yellow/cyan/purple/pink — 200 credits), Hero (crimson — 900 credits)
- [ ] Add `ownedCharacters` field to account schema (new accounts start with `["red","green","blue"]`)
- [ ] Add `credits` field to account schema (integer, starts at 0)
- [ ] Migration: accounts without `ownedCharacters` auto-receive all 8 pre-beta characters; Crimson excluded
- [ ] Lock UI: unowned characters show lock icon + price, cannot be selected, click redirects to shop
- [ ] Shop character purchase tab: check balance → deduct credits → add to `ownedCharacters` → unlock
- [ ] Bots use all 9 characters regardless of player ownership
- [ ] Add rarity/credit i18n keys to langs.js

### 1.4 Daily Gacha — `specs/daily-gacha.md`

- [ ] 6 pulls per day, reset at midnight (same `getTodayString()` logic)
- [ ] Reward pool: coins (50/100/200/400), credits (50/100/200/400), emotes (5), badges (7 excl. badge_none) — weighted probabilities per spec
- [ ] Duplicate emote/badge → auto-convert to coin value
- [ ] Gacha UI: overlay with result popup (icon + name + quantity), remaining pull counter
- [ ] Add gacha button to lobby UI + `#gacha-overlay` to index.html

---

## Priority 2 — Bugs & Missing Data (current code gaps)

### 2.1 `CHAR_STAT_BARS` Missing Purple & Pink — ✅ Fixed
- [x] `main.js:757-765`: Added `purple: { hp: 6, atk: 8, range: 5, speed: 6 }` and `pink: { hp: 10, atk: 7, range: 3, speed: 10 }`
- [ ] Add: `crimson: { ... }` (after Crimson is implemented, tracked under 1.5)

### 2.2 `charLevels` Missing Purple & Pink — ✅ Fixed
- [x] `createAccount()`: `charLevels` now includes `purple: 1, pink: 1`
- [x] Migration guard: added `purple`/`pink` backfill checks alongside existing yellow/cyan checks
- [ ] Add `crimson: 1` after Crimson is implemented (tracked under 1.5)

### 2.3 `cosmetics` Not Initialized in `createAccount()` — ✅ Fixed
- [x] `createAccount()` now sets `cosmetics` field directly (same shape as the `loadAccount()` migration default) — no longer relies on next-load migration

### 2.4 ~~Yellow Animation Fallthrough~~ — Not a bug (stale plan finding)
- Verified `main.js:5819`: Yellow is already grouped with Orange/Cyan in a dedicated windup-throw animation branch, does NOT fall through to Red's punch. No fix needed.

### 2.5 `alpha_red` Skin Missing `rarity` Field
- [ ] `main.js` SKINS definition (line 213): `alpha_red` has no `rarity` field — spec says add `rarity: "rare"` retroactively
- [ ] (Will be addressed as part of 1.6)

### 2.6 Version String Inconsistencies in `index.html` — ✅ Fixed
- [x] `index.html`: Lobby version badge `v1.4.2` → `v1.4.9`
- [x] `index.html`: CSS cache buster `styles.css?v=1.4.2` → `?v=1.4.9`
- [ ] Both should be updated whenever version bumps (ongoing process note, not a one-time fix)

### 2.7 `showDamageTakenIndicator` Unreachable — ✅ Fixed (wired up)
- [x] Confirmed the element/CSS animation (`damagePopDown`) were purpose-built but never called — wired into `applyDamage()` alongside the existing `createDamagePopup()` 3D popup for the player-damaged case

---

## Priority 3 — Spec Maintenance

### 3.1 Update `specs/overview.md`
- [x] Now says 9 characters (correct after Crimson) — already updated
- [ ] Verify all 18 features listed match actual implementation state after Beta Season 1

### 3.2 Update `specs/character-select.md`
- [x] Already updated to include Crimson + rarity tiers (9 characters)
- [ ] Verify lock/unlock mechanics match final implementation after 1.3 is done

### 3.3 Patch Notes for Recent Versions
- [ ] Verify all versions through v1.4.9 have patch notes (currently present in index.html)
- [ ] After Beta Season 1 work: add new version patch notes

---

## Priority 4 — Dead Code & Vestigial Cleanup

### 4.1 Dead Modules (not imported by main.js)
Files exist but are NOT used at runtime — `main.js` only imports `langs.js` and `multiplayer.js`:
- `src/character.js` — divergent stats from main.js CHARACTERS (8 chars, no crimson)
- `src/hud.js` — missing attack labels for yellow/cyan/purple/pink; imports non-existent `shared.js`/`combat.js`
- `src/animation.js` — missing Yellow/Crimson animation branches
- `src/LANGS/dom-core.js` — missing many newer element IDs; `DOM.survivorsPanel` targets non-existent `id="survivors-panel"`

Decision needed: sync all modules to match main.js, OR delete as dead code.

### 4.2 Vestigial State Fields
- [ ] `state.pointerLocked` (line 1014): declared `false`, never set `true` — remove
- [ ] `state.mouse.yaw` / `state.mouse.pitch`: set in 4 reset locations but never declared in initial state, never read — remove
- [ ] `state.winner`: set to `""` on reset but never updated after — remove or wire up

### 4.3 Stale Comments
- [ ] `src/LANGS/dom-core.js` line 1: comment says `// src/core/dom.js` — stale path

## Architecture Notes

- **Authoritative runtime**: `src/main.js` (~7538 lines, monolithic)
- **Translations**: `src/LANGS/langs.js` (flat key-value, ko + en — imported by main.js)
- **Multiplayer**: `src/multiplayer.js` (WebSocket client for Take Down mode — imported by main.js)
- **Entry point**: `index.html` → `src/main.js?v=1.4.9`
- **Dead modules**: `character.js`, `hud.js`, `animation.js`, `dom-core.js` — exist but not wired into main.js
- **No `src/lib/`** — no shared utility library
- **No bundler** — vanilla ES modules, Three.js r165 via CDN
